# 🧠 AI-Studio-ClearML

This repository provides a minimal, reproducible example of how to use [ClearML](https://clear.ml) to build machine learning pipelines, track experiments, and manage datasets using both **task-based pipelines** and **function-based pipelines**.

## 🧪 Features

- ✅ Task-based pipeline using `PipelineController.add_step(...)`
- [TBD] Function-based pipeline using `PipelineController.add_function_step(...)`
- ✅ Reusable ClearML Task templates
- ✅ Dataset and model artifact management with ClearML
- ✅ End-to-end ML workflow: Dataset → Preprocessing → Training
- ✅ Fully compatible with ClearML Hosted and ClearML Server

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install clearml
```

### 2. Configure ClearML

Set up ClearML by running:

```bash
clearml-init
```

You will be prompted to enter:
- ClearML Credential

Use [https://app.clear.ml](https://app.clear.ml) to register for a free account if needed.

---

### 3. Create a ClearML Agent
- Install the ClearML agent on your machine or server.
```bash
pip install clearml-agent
```
---

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Using Colab: refer to ClearML_Pipeline_Demo.ipynb.

### 🔁 Option 1: Pipeline from Predefined ClearML Tasks

To use a task-based pipeline, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Register the Base Tasks

**Before running the pipeline, execute the following scripts \*\*once\*\* to create reusable ClearML Tasks:**
> **Note:** When running for the first time, comment out \`task.execute_remotely()\` in the each .py file of the three tasks to successfully create a task template.

```bash
# Step 1: Upload dataset
python step1_dataset_artifact.py

# Step 2: Preprocess dataset
python step2_data_preprocessing.py

# Step 3: Train model
python step3_train_model.py
```

These will appear in your ClearML dashboard and serve as base tasks for the pipeline.

#### Step 1.5: Initial ClearML Queue
Create Queue with name as pipeline (or your customized one), ensure it is consistent in pipeline_from_tasks.py
```
pipe.start(queue="pipeline")
```

Run the agent for queue worker:

#### Step 2: Run the Pipeline

Once all base tasks are registered, run the pipeline:

```bash
python pipeline_from_tasks.py
```

---

### 🔧 [TBD] Option 2: Pipeline from Local Python Functions 

This version demonstrates using `add_function_step(...)` to wrap Python logic as pipeline steps.

---

### 🧩 Run Individual Pipeline Steps

You can run each task separately as well:

> **Note:** When running for the first time, comment out `task.execute_remotely()` in the code file to successfully create a task template.
> 
```bash
# Step 1: Upload dataset
python step1_dataset_artifact.py

# Step 2: Preprocess data
python step2_data_preprocessing.py

# Step 3: Train model
python step3_train_model.py
```
